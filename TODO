Things to investigate / fix:
  ✔ fix disassembly printing as bytes object (b'...') @done (20-01-11 09:14)
  ☐ tabs don't print correctly
  ✔ add reset hook & pass reset to peripherals @done (20-01-28 15:54)
  ✘ look at pyglet to handle console @cancelled (20-01-28 15:55)
  ✘ emulator.cb_buserror <- do something useful here @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)

  ☐ fix console in/output paths to be bytes all the way through
  ☐ fix disassembly
  ☐ fix symbolication
  ☐ fix tracing triggers
  ☐ 68681 timer interrupts are broken, counter mode is broken

    ✔ add_device_range(base, size, ID) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ bus error should be optional @done (20-01-24 21:51)

    ✔ table entry: valid bit, writable bit, handler ID @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ handlers for memory, device @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ emulator access to memory @done (20-01-25 23:24)
  ✔ multiple ELF files for symbol lookup @done (20-01-30 09:01)
  ✔ load ELF file to RAM & go @done (20-01-31 09:34)
