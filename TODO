Things to investigate / fix:
  ✔ fix disassembly printing as bytes object (b'...') @done (20-01-11 09:14)
  ☐ tabs don't print correctly
  ✔ add reset hook & pass reset to peripherals @done (20-01-28 15:54)
  ✘ look at pyglet to handle console @cancelled (20-01-28 15:55)
  ☐ emulator.cb_buserror <- do something useful here
  ☐ use device mapping handle to find devices faster? (limitation of 1 device per page regardless...)
  ☐ fix console in/output paths to be bytes all the way through
  
Features:
  ✔ need new memory model, support multiple disjoint memories (RAM, ROM), > 16MiB @done (20-01-28 15:54)
    ✔ implement m68k_read/write_memory_8/16/32(), m68k_read_disassembler_16/32 @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ add_memory_range(base, size, writable, with_contents(optional)) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ add_device_range(base, size, ID) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ bus error should be optional @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ flat mapping table for all of 32-bit space, one entry per mapping unit (e.g. 4k) @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ table entry: valid bit, writable bit, handler ID @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ handlers for memory, device @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ emulator access to memory @done (20-01-25 23:24)
  ☐ multiple ELF files for symbol lookup
  ☐ load ELF file to RAM & go
  ☐ inject arbitrary RAM contents

Devices:
  I2C:
    ☐ generic I2C 'bus'
    ☐ DS1232 RTC
    ☐ display?
  CF/ATA:
    ☐ reset behaviour
      Can't be done for Tiny68k as /CS1 is permanently high
    ✔ IDENTIFY DEVICE @done (20-01-11 09:14)
    ✔ option to set disk file @done (20-01-25 21:40)

Tiny68k:
  ☐ I2C realtime clock device 
  ☐ I2C EEPROM emulation
  ✔ --rom commandline argument, loads ROM -> RAM at startup @done (20-01-25 21:37)
  ✔ emulator.add_reset_hook -> call at reset @done (20-01-25 22:34)
  ✔ emulator.add_memory @done (20-01-25 22:52)
  ✔ --eeprom commandline argument, supplies EEPROM contents @done (20-01-28 15:54)
    ✔ if empty, don't copy ROM -> RAM @done (20-01-28 16:00)
  ✔ device registration base/length -> mem_add_device @done (20-01-28 15:54)
  
P90MB:
  ☐ device models
    ☐ UARTs
    ☐ CompactFlash
    ☐ Timers
    ☐ flash write interface
    ☐ I2C
    ☐ RC2014 boards?
  ☐ --rom commandline argument, places code in ROM

Simple:
  ☐ fix device models
  ☐ test cases
  
EmuTOS:
  ☐ Illegal instruction callbacks for Native Feature interfaces

Console:
  ✔ emulator socket connection @done (20-01-28 20:52)
    ✔ send output @done (20-01-28 15:44)
    ✔ collect input @done (20-01-28 17:45)
  ✔ "waiting for connection, hit ^C to exit" message @done (20-01-28 20:52)
  ✔ don't die on ^C in console server @done (20-01-28 20:52)
  ☐ wrapping protocol for additional widgets?
    ☐ consider urwid, curtsies, npyscreen as widget toolkits for this

Documentation:
  ☐ update README.md
