  ✘ look at pyglet to handle console @cancelled (20-01-28 15:55)
  ✘ emulator.cb_buserror <- do something useful here @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✘ use device mapping handle to find devices faster? (limitation of 1 device per page regardless...) @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)
  ☐ fix console in/output paths to be bytes all the way through
  ✔ fix disassembly @done (20-02-01 10:12)
  ✔ fix symbolication @done (20-02-01 10:12)
  ✘ fix tracing triggers @cancelled (20-02-01 10:12)
  ☐ interrupts are broken
  ✔ need to allow devices on arbitrary address boundaries; 4K is too coarse @done (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✔ --debug-device doesn't seem to work with a device and 'device' @done (20-02-02 23:00)
  ✔ suppress read traces for instruction fetches @done (20-02-02 18:24)
  
Features:
  ✔ need new memory model, support multiple disjoint memories (RAM, ROM), > 16MiB @done (20-01-28 15:54)
    ✔ implement m68k_read/write_memory_8/16/32(), m68k_read_disassembler_16/32 @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ add_memory_range(base, size, writable, with_contents(optional)) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ add_device_range(base, size, ID) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ bus error should be optional @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ flat mapping table for all of 32-bit space, one entry per mapping unit (e.g. 4k) @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ table entry: valid bit, writable bit, handler ID @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ handlers for memory, device @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ emulator access to memory @done (20-01-25 23:24)
  ✔ multiple ELF files for symbol lookup @done (20-01-30 09:01)
  ✔ load ELF file to RAM & go @done (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✘ inject arbitrary RAM contents @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)

Devices:
  ☐ root_device should signal bus error on failed register decode
  ✔ always call device.tick after handling register access @done (20-02-04 22:48)
    ✔ tick should also check for interrupt assertion @done (20-02-04 22:48)
    ✘ don't mask set_irq against CPSR @cancelled (20-02-04 22:48)
    ✔ scrub devices for redundant status updates @done (20-02-04 23:08)
    ✔ scrub devices : don't allow tick to return None @done (20-02-04 23:08)
  ☐ option to en/disable buserror generation
  ☐ console input should cause tick
  ☐ better handling of deadlines returned by tick - perhaps track a per-device deadline rather than just the lowest from the most recent poll? device register accesses can cause deadlines to be lost...
  I2C:
    ☐ generic I2C 'bus'
    ☐ DS1232 RTC
    ☐ display?
  CF/ATA:
    ✘ reset behaviour @cancelled (20-02-04 22:32)
      Can't be done for Tiny68k as /CS1 is permanently high
    ✔ IDENTIFY DEVICE @done (20-01-11 09:14)
    ✔ option to set disk file @done (20-01-25 21:40)

Tiny68k:
