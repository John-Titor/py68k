Things to investigate / fix:
  ✔ fix disassembly printing as bytes object (b'...') @done (20-01-11 09:14)
  ✘ tabs don't print correctly @cancelled (20-02-01 10:12)
  ✔ add reset hook & pass reset to peripherals @done (20-01-28 15:54)
  ✘ look at pyglet to handle console @cancelled (20-01-28 15:55)
  ✘ emulator.cb_buserror <- do something useful here @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✘ use device mapping handle to find devices faster? (limitation of 1 device per page regardless...) @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)
  ☐ fix console in/output paths to be bytes all the way through
  ✔ fix disassembly @done (20-02-01 10:12)
  ✔ fix symbolication @done (20-02-01 10:12)
  ✘ fix tracing triggers @cancelled (20-02-01 10:12)
  ✔ interrupts are broken @done (20-02-07 20:34)
  ✔ need to allow devices on arbitrary address boundaries; 4K is too coarse @done (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✔ --debug-device doesn't seem to work with a device and 'device' @done (20-02-02 23:00)
  ✔ suppress read traces for instruction fetches @done (20-02-02 18:24)
  ✔ newlib sbrk is busted; make stack bigger (room for stack + heap) & grow up from _end @done (20-02-08 23:32)
  ☐ exceptions in callbacks seem to trash the emulator state; probably better to hard-abort out of them
  ✔ decide between public attributes and property methods. Device._name, size, address - anything not computed. @done (20-02-15 09:35)
  ☐ lots of Emulator functionality needs an instance, but that's inconvenient; maybe classmethods? module-level functions?
  ☐ symbolication for e.g. address zero is printing vector names
    ☐ MAP operations should not symbolicate
  
Features:

    ✔ add_memory_range(base, size, writable, with_contents(optional)) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ add_device_range(base, size, ID) @done (20-01-24 22:38)
    ✔ bus error should be optional @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ flat mapping table for all of 32-bit space, one entry per mapping unit (e.g. 4k) @done (20-01-24 21:51)
    ✔ table entry: valid bit, writable bit, handler ID @done (20-01-24 21:51)

    ✔ emulator access to memory @done (20-01-25 23:24)
  ✔ multiple ELF files for symbol lookup @done (20-01-30 09:01)
  ✔ load ELF file to RAM & go @done (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✘ inject arbitrary RAM contents @cancelled (20-01-31 09:34)
  ✔ factor ROM loading into emu.add_memory rather than duplicating in the target @done (20-02-08 09:35)

Tracing:
  Needs a complete rethink
  ☐ trace message via NatFeat
  ☐ tracing on/off for-X-cycles via NatFeat
  ☐ device read/write
  ☐ memory read/write
  ☐ register mapping
  ☐ memory mapping
  ☐ instruction execution
  ☐ exceptions
  ☐ jumps
  ☐ ipl set
  ☐ interrupt acknowledge
  ☐ spurious interrupt
  ☐ quantum start / end
  ☐ emulator, device debug message
Devices:
  ☐ root_device should signal bus error on failed register decode
  ✔ always call device.tick after handling register access @done (20-02-04 22:48)
    ✔ tick should also check for interrupt assertion @done (20-02-04 22:48)
    ✘ don't mask set_irq against CPSR @cancelled (20-02-04 22:48)
    ✔ scrub devices for redundant status updates @done (20-02-04 23:08)
    ✔ scrub devices : don't allow tick to return None @done (20-02-04 23:08)
  ☐ option to en/disable buserror generation
  ☐ console input should cause tick
  ✔ better handling of deadlines returned by tick - perhaps track a per-device deadline rather than just the lowest from the most recent poll? device register accesses can cause deadlines to be lost... @done (20-02-07 20:34)
  ✔ some way to pass options to devices without having them be commandline args -> use **options @done (20-02-08 00:09)
  ✔ tick -> callback_at / callback_after @done (20-02-08 23:34)
    ✔ identify callbacks with dev/'name' tuple, attrs when and who-to-call @done (20-02-08 23:34)
    ☐ migrate existing tick logic to callbacks @high
  ✔ hash register/size/direction to handler rather than just address to read/write handlers @done (20-02-13 22:33)
  ☐ support 'fallback' handlers (16-bit access to 8 or 32-bit registers, etc.)
  ✔ --trace-io is global, would be nice to have per-dev tracing effective here @done (20-02-18 23:15)
  ✔ Device.__trace/__diagnostic is a mess, rethink -> use logging framework? @done (20-02-18 23:15)
  68681:

   ☐ implement echo & loopback modes @low
  I2C:
    ☐ generic I2C 'bus'

    ☐ display?
  CF/ATA:
    ✘ reset behaviour @cancelled (20-02-04 22:32)

    ✔ option to set disk file @done (20-01-25 21:40)
